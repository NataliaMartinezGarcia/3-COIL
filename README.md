# 1. Project Overview
This GitHub project is a collaboration between the students of Seneca Polytechnic in Toronto, Ontario, and the students of Universidade de Coruna in Spain.

The goal of this project is the development of an application that can create linear regression models.

The app will allow users to create and visualize simple and multiple regression models starting from data stored in CSV, Excel, and database (SQLite) files. 
It will enable them to make predictions based on the models they have created and save and load them.

## 1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that allow machines to perform actions that would otherwise be performed by humans. Common examples include:
reasoning, decision making, and problem solving.

## 1.2 What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a data analysis technique that predicts the value of unknown data by using another related and known data value.
It mathematically models the unknown or dependent variable and the known or independent variable as a linear equation.

### 1.2.1 How does it apply to the project?
Users can generate independent variables by inputting data from their external datasets. The artificial intelligence within the application will then calculate the
dependent variable and create the linear regression model.
